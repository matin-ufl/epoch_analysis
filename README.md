# Epoch Analysis

This project finds the epochs in on-the-hip accelerometer data for LIFE study.

It tries to find similar groups sharing epoch characteristics, and examine their known similarities. This study tries to relate the found accelerometer-epoch cluster to other possible variables; such as health, cognitition, and mobility status.
